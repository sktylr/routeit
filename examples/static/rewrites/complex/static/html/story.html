    <h1>The Tale of a Tiny URL</h1>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, a humble URL named <code>/blog</code> wanted to be more useful. 
      But no one knew it pointed to <code>/content/articles/2025/blog.html</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the Rewrite Engine â€” a magical tool that gave <code>/blog</code> a purpose and clarity.
      With a single rule, it transformed the cryptic path into a clean, memorable link.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, <code>/blog</code> lived happily ever after, forever bookmarked in users' hearts.
