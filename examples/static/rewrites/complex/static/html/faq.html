    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h3>Q: Is URL rewriting the same as redirection?</h3>
    <p>No. Rewriting happens server-side and is invisible to the user, while redirection changes the browser’s URL.</p>
    
    <h3>Q: Can I use URL rewriting for SEO?</h3>
    <p>Yes, it’s one of the main use cases. Cleaner URLs are better for users and search engines alike.</p>
    
    <h3>Q: Is URL rewriting safe?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely — if used correctly and validated to avoid path traversal attacks.</p>
